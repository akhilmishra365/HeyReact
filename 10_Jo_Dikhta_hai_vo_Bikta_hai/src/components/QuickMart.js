//?dekho behind the scene normal accordiuym me yhe tha ki hr section apni state maintain kr ra tha is visble true jb hmne carrers ke show pe click kiya toh uska state true ho gya ai=ur baki ka jo tha vo vaise hi ra 
//?isi trah jb hmne is carres ke hide pe click kiya uska is visble false ho gya aur baki sb ka jo tha vhi ra 

//!Ab HM YE CHAH RE KI JB HM CARRERS KE SHOW PE CLICK KRE TOH VO OPEN HO I.E IS USKA SET STATE TRUE HO JAYE BAKI SB KA FALSE HO JAYE TAKI VO HIDE HO JAYE BASICALLY AB HME SIBLINGS KE STATE KO CHANGE KRNA HAI ;

//basically we want to modify the state of siblings that is is about us se khde hoke carrers ki sgtate ko modify krdenn;

//!!!!!??????!!!!!?@@@?@     THE ANSWER IS WE CANNOT CHANGE THE STATE OF A SIBLING LIKE THAT DIRECTLY   WE CANNOT MODIFY  STATE OF A SIBLING FROM AN ANOTHER COMPONENT   //!!!!!!!!!!!!!?@@@@@@@@@@@@

//?TO DO THIS WE HAVE TO PLAY A SMART GAME INSTEAD OF EACH SECTION MAINTAINING ITS OWN STATE  WE CAN MAINTAIN THE STATE OF ALL THE SECTIONS IN THE PARENT COMPONENT AND PASS THE STATE AND THE FUNCTION TO CHANGE THE STATE AS PROPS TO THE CHILDREN COMPONENTS
//I WILL TAKE CONTROL OF SHOW HIDE FROM THIS CHILDRENS TO PARENT
